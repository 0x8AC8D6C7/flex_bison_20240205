# This is a learning record for the book *Flex&Bison* by John R.Levine
Most interesting code in the book has been recorded under the directory 'books-exps'

The code recorded in this project was not strictly arranged according to the content in the book, but was recorded in the form of a project. For example, the calculator used as a introduction in the book is placed in the calculator directory instead of being arranged according to chapter such as Example 1-4.

In general, this repository is my record for learning Flex&Bison, **not a strictly meaningful project**.

# Firstly build/run
Ensure you have flex and bison in your system. For Ubuntu, you can run init.sh to install:
```bash
sudo bash ./init.sh
```
